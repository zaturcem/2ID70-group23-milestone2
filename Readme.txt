This is a template project for team project of 2ID70 2024.

Various comments in the main.py file indicate where functionality needs to be implemented. These comments are marked TODO.

You are allowed to change main.py only at the places where it is clearly indicated (with the TODO comments). You should not change the code in other places. You can, however, add new functions to keep your code better organized.

Do make sure that there exists a file called "main.py" which contains the 'main module statement' of the form "if __name__ == '__main__':".

You can ZIP the main.py file using any common compression tool. The archive should be called app.zip and can be uploaded as such to the server. Ensure that the archive **does not** contain folders!

Good luck on the project!
